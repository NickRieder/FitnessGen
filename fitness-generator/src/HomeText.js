`KaloRenics was created from the vision of Ohio State University's 
Personal Trainer, Danil Bagin. Danil stated, “I want to develop for 
easy access, a fitness resource that people can use when they are starting 
to learn how to properly workout. This is a freemium model which allows users 
to get specific, computer-generated programming based on their initial inputs to 
questions and their ability to pass specific assessments, but does not require 
them to spend hundreds of dollars on a tailored program.”`

This vision was passed 
to a group of college students to complete for their capstone project. Every member 
of the team was passionate about their health, and knew this project was a perfect 
fit. Your individual energy is the amazing feeling that comes to life inside you 
when you are happy and believe in yourself. Everyone is inspired and motivated by 
different events or happenings that are typically only partial to them.

We would 
like to help play a role or assist in the development of oneself by providing a 
free website that produces fitness programs tailored uniquely for each individual. 
Thus, under direct supervision of Danil, KaloRenics was born.`

The ancient Greeks believed in the beauty of the human body. Socrates, a famous Greek philosopher, 
is quoted saying “It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of 
which his body is capable.” Here at KaloRenics, we took that to heart. Literally… 

Our mission is to empower people looking to get healthier and in better shape. That is, 
we want everyone to be incorporated in the fitness community. Not just Gym Rat Chad. 
How did we do that? By creating a fitness generator to create custom, user-specific exercise 
programs just for you. You know what the best part is? It is absolutely FREE so you don’t 
have to spend hundreds of dollars on those athlete-based, unadaptable programs.

lose weight/gain muscle? Our programs are designed to help you meet your goals in a healthy, 
functional, and long-lasting way. No gym membership? Our program adapts to your surroundings

feeling, looking, and moving better. Not only should this help generate a positive attitude, 
but the user should live a longer, happier, and healthier life! Let's get to work!
